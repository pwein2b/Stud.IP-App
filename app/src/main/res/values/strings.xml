They are encrypted in a file, which only the app can access, but if the operating system itself is hacked (or you rooted your device), another app could get the key from the operating system and decrypt the username and password.\nBut for normal use it should be safe enough.\nThe advantage over a session cookie is that a session cookie eventually expires and you have to log in again. Because with HTTP Basic Authentication the username and password are stored on the device, you only have to log in once (as log as you don\'t change the password).</string>
    <string name="auth_cookie">session cookie</string>
    <string name="auth_cookie_desc">This is the method browsers use. Username and password are used to fetch a session cookie, after that the password is deleted.\nOnly the cookie is saved on the device, with the same security as the password with HTTP Basic Authentication. If the cookie is leaked, someone can impersonate you for as long as the cookie lasts, but they cannot change your password.\nThe downside is that the cookie eventually expires and you have to log in again.</string>

    <string name="auth_oauth_desc">Not implemented yet. The safest method: It works like a session cookie, but instead of entering the username and password in the app, you are redirected to the Stud.IP-Server and have to log in there.\nThe app only gets the authentication token afterwards, which works like a session cookie.</string>

<h2>1. Login</h2>
First you should choose you authentication method from the settings.<br>
If you only want to log in once, you should use HTTP Basic authentication.<br>

<br><br>
<h2>2. General & Settings</h2>
All dialogs and screens use swipe-to-refresh to get new data from the server.<br>
Apart from the files all data is cached on the device and can be viewed without an internet connection.<br>
The files have to be downloaded manually on demand.<br>
The notification service can send you notifications if the data changes.<br>
You can set the update frequency and notification priority in the settings.<br>
The notification service only shows notifications you enabled in the Stud.IP notification settings.<br>
These settings can be changed in-app under "Stud.IP notification settings".<br>
With the document provider you can use your Stud.IP files like all other files on your device.<br>
After you logged in, you can use the settings screen to select the courses you wish to expose via the document provider.<br>
You can also set whether to show image previews when using mobile data.<br><br>

<h2>3. Home</h2>
On this screen you can see your Stud.IP name and the global Stud.IP news.<br><br>

Add the addressee by tapping it in the list.<br>
Long press on an addressee to remove it.<br>
<br><br>

<br><br>

<h2>8. Meetings plugin</h2>
Tapping the meetings icon for a course loads all meeting rooms available.<br>
When you click a button, a new window will open with the BigBlueButton conference.<br>
Currently only works with HTTP basic auth.<br>
When navigating away, the window automatically goes into picture-in-picture mode and the presentation is set to fullscreen, so the conference can continue without interruption.<br>
As long as the conference is active, there is a non-dismissable notification present.<br>
The notification has actions to exit the conference and to toggle the microphone.<br>
Tapping the notification returns to the conference in full-screen.<br>
The PiP-window also has a button to toggle the microphone.<br>
