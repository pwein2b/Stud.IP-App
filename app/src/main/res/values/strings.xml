    <string name="auth_basic">HTTP Basic Authentication</string>
    <string name="auth_basic_desc">With HTTP Basic Authentication the username and password is send with every request.\nTo secure your password, unencrypted connections are refused.\nThe username and password have to be saved on the device. They are encrypted in a file, which only the app can access, but if the operating system itself is hacked (or you rooted your device), another app could get the key from the operating system and decrypt the username and password.\nBut for normal use it should be safe enough.\nThe advantage over a session cookie is that a session cookie eventually expires and you have to log in again. Because with HTTP Basic Authentication the username and password are stored on the device, you only have to log in once (as log as you don\'t change the password).</string>
    <string name="auth_cookie">session cookie</string>
    <string name="auth_cookie_desc">This is the method browsers use. Username and password are used to fetch a session cookie, after that the password is deleted.\nOnly the cookie is saved on the device, with the same security as the password with HTTP Basic Authentication. If the cookie is leaked, someone can impersonate you for as long as the cookie lasts, but they cannot change your password.\nThe downside is that the cookie eventually expires and you have to log in again.</string>
    <string name="auth_oauth">OAuth 2</string>
    <string name="auth_oauth_desc">Not implemented yet. The safest method: It works like a session cookie, but instead of entering the username and password in the app, you are redirected to the Stud.IP-Server and have to log in there.\nThe app only gets the authentication token afterwards, which works like a session cookie.</string>
    <string name="settings_developer">Developer settings:\nThese settings could make the app unstable or lower the security. Use at your own risk.</string>
