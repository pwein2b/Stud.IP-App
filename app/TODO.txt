            [x] Courseware plugin, play opencast videos linked in courseware
            [x] add the studip notification settings to the settings screen, so you can control from the app what notifications you get
            [x] add the option to not load opencast previews when on mobile data
            [x] add the option to not load image previews when on mobile data
            [x] add screenshots
            [ ] meetings plugin

                [x] use android:keepScreenOn in the layout
                [x] make it an activity, handle orientation changes myself, or else the WebView with the conference gets destroyed
                [x] https://medium.com/cs-random-thoughts-on-tech/android-retain-webview-on-orientation-change-best-practices-be29fd7e56e3
                [x] or just lock the screen in landscape mode, but the WebView still has to be retained for other configuration changes
                [ ] Test what the minimum API level is where BBB works in the WebView. works >= 25
                [ ] Test why the webcam doesn't work on-device
                [ ] check if the WebView is really destroyed when the activity is closed, so the user really exits the conference and can't be heard
                [ ] support PiP for the meetings
                    [/] hide/show everything but the presentation for PiP-mode, with javascript injection
                    [ ] add action buttons to mute/unmute, disable webcam
            [x] bump version
            [x] update description, add camera and MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS description
            [x] add explanation for additional permissions added by the libraries, namely FOREGROUND_SERVICE, WAKELOCK, START_AT_BOOT
            [x] update help text
        1.0.0:
            [ ] delete data which is not in a server response, but still in the database
            [ ] support for the planner
            [ ] app widget for the planner
            [ ] option to browse the web version in an activity with a fullscreen WebView
            [ ] API detection:
                [ ] if api.php/user failed, try discovery to see if the API is even enabled
                    [ ] if yes, but api.php/user is not enabled, tell the user
                [ ] see what routes are needed for what features, tell user on login which features are unavailable
                [ ] fail without message for features where the routes are disabled
            [ ] bump version
            [ ] update help text
            [ ] update description
        1.1.0:
            [ ] add support for JSONAPI (probably requires abstracting away the api routes a bit more)
                [ ] use JSONAPI if possible
                [ ] for features only available for JSONAPI, fail gracefully and inform the user, or hide the feature to begin with, or emulate the feature
            [ ] make more specific rules for proguard, so unused code can be removed
            [ ] bump version

TODO: intent filter for sending a message to someone


    
    For the notification service:
    Notifications work over this api with the session cookie: /dispatch.php/jsupdater/get
    caution: just returns an empty list if the session isn't valid
    test whether it works with basic auth: no, only works with a session cookie.
    When using basic auth: add a method to API to refresh the session cookie.
    
    For the mails: presumably all javascript-used routes only work with a session cookie.
    Use the same technique for the route to get users

    messages: avoid reloading ALL messages, load one at a time and stop when the first cached message is encountered
    
    after logging in, check for available API-routes and tell the user if features aren't available because the provider disabled the API route
    add a settings button to re-perform the check, so the user doesn't have to log out if an API-route is enabled

Add the ability to transfer app data to another phone via bluetooth.
A one-time-password is generated and the user has to enter it on the app of the other phone.
A key is derived from this password and all data encrypted with it.

IMPORTANT: If LiveData changes while an activity is in the stopped state and then returns to resumed, does it get the update?
https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata
Always up to date data
    If a lifecycle becomes inactive, it receives the latest data upon becoming active again.

    general:
        To make a new icon from a svg, convert it to a png with GIMP and then use it in android studio
    
    plugins:
        plugins don't seem to have a REST api defined, probably because there wasn't an app for so long
        
        make issues on github for the plugins to define REST-APIs:

        courseware:
            to get the courseware html for a course: /plugins.php/courseware/courseware?cid=
            cid is the course-id
            
        meetings:
            url: /plugins.php/meetingplugin/index?cid=
            BigBlueButton is already made for mobile use, so a WebView with the session cookie should be enough.
            
            TODO A WebView reloads when the parent is destroyed because of a configuration change. That would result in someone being temporarily kicked out of a meeting when the device is turned.
                 Make the meetings plugin its own activity and disable configuration changes in it.
                
                use android:keepScreenOn in the layout of the activity
