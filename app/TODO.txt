    TODO for android 12:
        [ ] https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/web-intent-resolution#request-user-associate-app-with-domain
           upon login, request for the user to associate the app with the host used to log in
        [ ] for the meetings activity, set the PiP-Params to setSeamlessResizeEnabled(true);
        [ ] opt-out of stretching for overscroll?
        [ ] https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/splash-screen
            customize the splash screen?

    Roadmap:
        1.0.0:
            [ ] deep links improvements
                [ ] support for more link types, for courseware, opencast and meetings links
                [ ] for messages, load the message if it isn't already, and view it
                [ ] link to the course info and member screens
                [ ] link to the planner
                [ ] open unknown link patterns in the WebView for the server
            [ ] delete data which is not in a server response, but still in the database
            [ ] better updating of messages, so not every message is downloaded on update, only the ones until a saved one is found
                [ ] don't care about deleting messages deleted from the server, the user can just also delete them locally
                [ ] when a message is deleted, don't sync with the server, just send a delete and delete it from the database
            [ ] add the course info dialog
            [ ] add the course members dialog
            [ ] add the user info dialog
            [ ] support for the planner
            [ ] app widget for the planner
            [ ] option to browse the web version in an activity with a fullscreen WebView
                [ ] set user agent to mobile
                [ ] redirect page loads for pages not on the server to the browser
                [ ] allow javascript
            [ ] messages
                [ ] add support for viewing the outbox
                [ ] add the ability to upload attachments after a message was send, via the dispatch route
                    [ ] strangely seems to work for all messages, even send ones, may not be stable, because it isn't in the API
                    [ ] the email is send without the attachment if it is attached later
            [ ] API detection:
                [x] better error message when login fails
                [x] see what routes are needed for what features, tell user on login which features are unavailable
                [ ] disable functions according to disabled features
                [x] option to ignore unavailable features, features may partly work if some routes are enabled
                [x] add the option to res-scan for features in the settings screen
                [x] fail without message for features where the routes are disabled
                [x] put the used routes in the Github Readme
            [ ] fully save UI state
                [ ] save the scrolling position in ScrollViews? Giving the ScrollViews an ID makes it safe itself automatically
                [ ] save the selected semester in the courses screen
                [ ] SavedStateModule for all ViewModels for special data not from the database
                    All objects have to be serializable correctly for this.
                    The limit is 1mb, the CoursewareViewModel could exceed that. In that case, write the data to a file in the cache folder in a lifecycle method
                    , make sure the document provider doesn't delete it on startup, and delete it when it is read.
                    [ ] maybe store the opencast und courseware data in the database?
                    [ ] MeetingsRoomsViewModel
                    [ ] OpencastViewModel
                    [ ] CoursewareViewModel
                    [ ] FileViewModel
                    [ ] ForumViewModel: current parent entry
                    [ ] selected semester for courses screen
                    [ ] measure the performance after these changes, check if re-creation from an configuration change is still fast
                        https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/testing-app-startup-performance-36169c27ee55
            [x] rework UI
                [x] remove the "Experimental Features" text from the settings, the features work quite reliably
                [x] remove the "developer settings" not used anyways
                [x] try to find nicer colors for dark mode
                [x] space everything more out in general
                [x] courses screen
                    [x] space the icons wider out, make them into 2 rows for each course
                [x] courseware
                    [x] fix the bug that causes the buttons for opencast videos to display incorrectly when in landscape mode
            [x] bump version
            [ ] update help text
            [ ] come up with an actual name, check if it is taken
            [ ] new & more screenshots, with UI improvements
            [ ] update description
        1.1.0:
            [ ] support for OAuth1 for authentication
                https://oauth1.wp-api.org/docs/basics/Auth-Flow.html
                https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2665796/android-handle-oauth-callback-using-intent-filter
                [x] make a class with the hostnames and OAuth data for supported servers
                [ ] extra error message when OAuth isn't supported for the app by a server, tell the user to send a predefined message to the admin,
                    to enable OAuth support for the Stud.IP installation.
                [ ] The callback uri doesn't seem to work, the browser doesn't redirect to it
                [ ] authorize the token via an intent to the browser
                [ ] add OAuth authentication to the downloads
                [ ] add an authentication interceptor for oauth authentication, save the token in the API shared preferences
                [ ] check: do things which require a session cookie work with OAuth? Do you get a session cookie when using OAuth?
                    [ ] some features might have to be disabled, or only supported via the new JSONAPI, or require the user to log in in the app
            [ ] blubber
                [ ] support for personal chats via blubber
                [ ] option to check for blubber messages more frequently than normal notifications, and to only enable this when connected to wifi
                [ ] support for course blubbers
                [ ] if you invite people to a personal blubber, does it become a group chat?
                [ ] whatsapp-like list for chats, try to emulate a messenger app with blubber
        1.2.0:
            [ ] add support for JSONAPI (probably requires abstracting away the api routes a bit more)
                https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35502079/custom-converter-for-retrofit-2
                [ ] JSONAPI is enabled on demo.studip.de, use that to test the implementation
                [ ] JSONAPI has a route to get all files/folders for a course, use that for the search function
                [ ] database and everything should still use the data classes, let the JSONAPI format be translated to that
                [ ] JSONAPI to POJO library?
                [ ] use JSONAPI if possible
                [ ] for features only available for JSONAPI, fail gracefully and inform the user, or hide the feature to begin with, or emulate the feature
            [ ] make more specific rules for proguard, so unused code can be removed
            [ ] bump version
        1.3.0:
            [ ] option to input the file size limit of the Stud.IP system, to let the documents provider automatically break up and recombine
                files above the limit, to support arbitrarily large files
            [ ] plugins:
                [ ] vips
                [ ] etherpad
            [ ] bump version

TODO:
    add the studip notification settings to the settings screen, so you can control from the app what notifications you get.
    
    
TODO: intent filter for sending a message to someone


    
    For the notification service:
    Notifications work over this api with the session cookie: /dispatch.php/jsupdater/get
    caution: just returns an empty list if the session isn't valid
    test whether it works with basic auth: no, only works with a session cookie.
    When using basic auth: add a method to API to refresh the session cookie.
    
    For the mails: presumably all javascript-used routes only work with a session cookie.
    Use the same technique for the route to get users

    use paging for large lists:

    messages: avoid reloading ALL messages, load one at a time and stop when the first cached message is encountered
    
    after logging in, check for available API-routes and tell the user if features aren't available because the provider disabled the API route
    add a settings button to re-perform the check, so the user doesn't have to log out if an API-route is enabled

Add the ability to transfer app data to another phone via bluetooth.
A one-time-password is generated and the user has to enter it on the app of the other phone.
A key is derived from this password and all data encrypted with it.

IMPORTANT: If LiveData changes while an activity is in the stopped state and then returns to resumed, does it get the update?
https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata
Always up to date data
    If a lifecycle becomes inactive, it receives the latest data upon becoming active again.

    plugins:
        plugins don't seem to have a REST api defined, probably because there wasn't an app for so long
