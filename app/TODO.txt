TODO:
    rework the api to also get session cookies on login, to use in VideoViews and WebViews


TODO finish the option to only save a session cookie, so the password doesn't have to be stored and make it the default method



    TODO publish on f-droid:

    general:
        To make a new icon from a svg, convert it to a png with GIMP and then use it in android studio
         The API also seems to work with session cookies, as it works with them in the browser.
        Fix freezing while refreshing by using a handler that gets called in the UI thread after a request is done-
    
    plugins:
        plugins don't seem to have a REST api defined, probably because there wasn't an app for so long
        
        make issues on github for the plugins to define REST-APIs:

        https://github.com/elan-ev/studip-opencast-plugin/issues
        
        courseware:
            to get the courseware html for a course: /plugins.php/courseware/courseware?cid=
            cid is the course-id
        opencast:
            to get the opencast html for a course: /plugins.php/opencast/course/index/false?cid=
            cid is the course-id
            page for the individual videos:
            /paella/ui/watch.html?cid=&id=
            id is the video id
            but the video pages use a special opencast video player.
            but the links to the actual files are in the source of the course page near the download button
        meetings:
            url: /plugins.php/meetingplugin/index?cid=
            BigBlueButton is already made for mobile use, so a WebView with the session cookie should be enough
        vips:
            url: /plugins.php/vipsplugin/sheets?cid=
            
            
        
        
        maybe use WebViews to display the plugins? or just include a html parser library and filter out the important parts?
        html parsing+VideoView is viable for opencast, as you just need to get the individual video URLs
        you can set the URI for VideoView, as well as the HTML-headers, so the cookies
