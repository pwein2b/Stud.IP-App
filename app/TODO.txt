    It seems like there is a bug that prevents you from posting on the Forum via the API. Use the dispatch route instead?

    For the notification service:
    Notifications work over this api with the session cookie: /dispatch.php/jsupdater/get
    caution: just returns an empty list if the session isn't valid
    test whether it works with basic auth: no, only works with a session cookie.
    When using basic auth: add a method to API to refresh the session cookie.
    
    For the mails: presumably all javascript-used routes only work with a session cookie.
    Use the same technique for the route to get users

    use paging for large lists:

    messages: avoid reloading ALL messages, load one at a time and stop when the first cached message is encountered
    
    after logging in, check for available API-routes and tell the user if features aren't available because the provider disabled the API route
    add a settings button to re-perform the check, so the user doesn't have to log out if an API-route is enabled
    
    rework the communication with the API with a library:

    instead of playing the videos in the app itself, make a content provider and share a URI to access the video to a video player app

Add the ability to transfer app data to another phone via bluetooth.
A one-time-password is generated and the user has to enter it on the app of the other phone.
A key is derived from this password and all data encrypted with it.

TODO Use a ViewModel to fix the configuration change bugs once and for all

IMPORTANT: If LiveData changes while an activity is in the stopped state and then returns to resumed, does it get the update?

Always up to date data
    If a lifecycle becomes inactive, it receives the latest data upon becoming active again.

    general:
        To make a new icon from a svg, convert it to a png with GIMP and then use it in android studio
        The API also seems to work with session cookies, as it works with them in the browser.
        Fix freezing while refreshing by using a handler that gets called in the UI thread after a request is done.
    
    plugins:
        plugins don't seem to have a REST api defined, probably because there wasn't an app for so long
        
        make issues on github for the plugins to define REST-APIs:
        https://github.com/virtUOS/courseware/issues
        https://github.com/virtUOS/studip-meeting/issues
        https://github.com/elan-ev/studip-opencast-plugin/issues
        
        courseware:
            to get the courseware html for a course: /plugins.php/courseware/courseware?cid=
            cid is the course-id
        opencast:
            to get the opencast html for a course: /plugins.php/opencast/course/index/false?cid=
            cid is the course-id
            page for the individual videos:
            /paella/ui/watch.html?cid=&id=
            id is the video id
            but the video pages use a special opencast video player.
            but the links to the actual files are in the source of the course page near the download button.
            
            Use a VideoView to display the video.
            
            enable PiP-mode when using the opencast plugin, with normal media controls
            
        meetings:
            url: /plugins.php/meetingplugin/index?cid=
            BigBlueButton is already made for mobile use, so a WebView with the session cookie should be enough.
            
            TODO A WebView reloads when the parent is destroyed because of a configuration change. That would result in someone being temporarily kicked out of a meeting when the device is turned.
                 Make the meetings plugin its own activity and disable configuration changes in it.
                ( Or try a custom tab. Maybe the invite link is enough to join a meeting.) No, the session cookie is needed
                
                use android:keepScreenOn in the layout of the activity
            
            
            
            Enable PiP-Mode when a meeting is displayed and add custom controls to toggle audio, microphone, camera, screen share.

        maybe use WebViews to display the plugins? or just include a html parser library and filter out the important parts?
        html parsing+VideoView is viable for opencast, as you just need to get the individual video URLs.
        You can set the URI for VideoView, as well as the HTML-headers, so the cookies
