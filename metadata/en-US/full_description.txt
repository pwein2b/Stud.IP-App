The API of the system has to be enabled to use this app.

In development and currently undergoing a rewrite.
Before the rewrite the app could show courses, show forums, download and upload your own files and course files,
read and write messages and show course and global announcements.
But there were some bugs that were hard to fix without a rewrite, and it was hard to continue developing it.

At the moment it can only show global news, but the old features should be back in relatively short time.
