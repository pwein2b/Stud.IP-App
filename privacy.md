# Privacy policy

No personal data is ever send to the developer or third parties, except your Stud.IP server.  
All data stays on the device or, when needed (e.g. for the username and password during login, sending a message, posting on a forum...), is send encrypted to the Stud.IP server you explicitly chose during login.  
Once the data is send to the server, this app has no control over how it is processed. Instead, see the privacy policy of your Stud.IP server.  
The data is held in app-specific storage, where (without root access) no other app can access it.  
Login data is additionally encrypted.  
  
The microphone and camera permissions are only needed for BigBlueButton meetings, and data from these is only collected during a meeting and only used for that meeting, and nothing else.  
The storage permission is only used to upload and download files from your Stud.IP server.  
The permissions can be turned off without impacting other app functions.  
  
The network connections permission is only used to determine if the device is currently on a mobile network with a data cap, so the user can choose not to load images in that case.
