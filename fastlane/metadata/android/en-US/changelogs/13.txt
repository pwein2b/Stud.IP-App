Links in the forum are now clickable.

Added Support for OAuth authentication.
Added shortcuts.
UI improvements:
- Fixed button text color for dark mode
- changed dark mode colors
- Text now doesn't go up to the edge of the screen, so it's easier to read.
- Same thing with dialog edges.
- The icons in the courses screen are now in 2 rows and spaced out, so you don't accidentally click the wrong one.
- all screens now always remember the scrolling position, so you return exactly where you left when clicking the app in the Recents screen.
