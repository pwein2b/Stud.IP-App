The API of the system has to be enabled to use this app.

In development and currently undergoing a rewrite.
Before the rewrite the app could show courses, show forums, download and upload your own files and course files,
read and write messages and show course and global announcements.
But there were some bugs that were hard to fix without a rewrite, and it was hard to continue developing it.

For Help: Settings:view help

If the app crashes and the crash log contains (you have to scroll down a bit)
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Room cannot verify the data integrity. Looks like you've changed schema...
or
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: A migration from 1 to 2 was required but not found...
there have been changes to the database.
To fix this, you have to delete the app data by using
Settings->Apps->all apps->Stud.IP->Storage & cache->Clear storage.
