If the app crashes and the crash log contains (you have to scroll down a bit)
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Room cannot verify the data integrity. Looks like you've changed schema...
or
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: A migration from 1 to 2 was required but not found...
there have been changes to the database.
To fix this, you have to delete the app data by using
